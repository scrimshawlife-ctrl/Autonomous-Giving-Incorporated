Autonomously Giving Incorporated (AGI) is the corporate brand and public, evidence-first entry point for its giving platform. It explains how a funding decision can become an inspectable impact story without exposing donor records or claiming that this site moves money. Zero State is the software builder and appears only in the footer credit.

## Product suite

| Product      | Role                                     | Live surface                                                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AGI          | Explains the funding-to-evidence journey | [Public workbench](https://autogive.app/)             |
| Portfolio Signals   | Publishes decision and campaign signals  | [Decision workspace](https://autogive.app/portfolio-signals/) |
| Impact Relay | Publishes verified aggregate outcomes    | [Public evidence](https://autogive.app/impact-relay/) |

The visitor journey is **AGI → Portfolio Signals → Impact Relay**. The data narrative is **Portfolio Signals decision → AGI explanation → Impact Relay evidence**.

## Suite GitHub Project

Cross-repo delivery board for AGI, Portfolio Signals, Impact Relay, and Specs:

- [docs/GITHUB-PROJECT.md](docs/GITHUB-PROJECT.md)
- Bootstrap: [`scripts/setup-github-project.sh`](scripts/setup-github-project.sh)

## Platform specification

Pinned platform canon: **[Autonomous Giving Specs v1.0.0](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Autonomous-Giving-Specs/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**.

Conformance declaration: [`platform-spec/conformance.yml`](platform-spec/conformance.yml). See [`platform-spec/README.md`](platform-spec/README.md).

## Allocation middleware

Transaction-light **middleware** between donation platforms (canonical **every.org**) and human allocation: pots → allocate → proof → exception inbox → board packet. Not a finance ledger.

**Status (2026-08-07):** MVP in [Fund-Intel `services/allocation-middleware/`](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Fund-Intel/tree/main/services/allocation-middleware); unit tests + **local pilot smoke green** against platform Supabase. Production middleware host + live every.org webhook remain open. AGI stays the public explanatory workbench.

## Current status

AGI is a static Next.js export. **Production** deploys on [Vercel](docs/VERCEL.md) at [autogive.app](https://autogive.app/); GitHub Pages remains a fallback mirror. Path suite:

| Path | Product |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | AGI public workbench |
| `/portfolio-signals/` | Portfolio Signals public + **workspace** login |
| `/impact-relay/` | Impact Relay public aggregates |

**Phase 2 (platform Auth + workspace)** is **operator-complete** (2026-08-07): platform Supabase `utdioxwiskzatwoejgiu`, migrations, Vercel anon env, master_admin login verified. **Phase 3** (allocation middleware public host + IR live cohort) is in progress. See [docs/PLATFORM.md](docs/PLATFORM.md).

During the production build AGI requests two approved public aggregate documents:

- Portfolio Signals `data/public-campaign.json`
- Impact Relay `data/public-impact.json`

The build accepts only the expected public authority declarations and a verified aggregate outcome. Network failures, malformed data, missing evidence, or disallowed authority values fail closed to the deterministic local scenario.

The **AGI marketing site** does **not** collect donations, authenticate operators, persist private records, or expose donor-level evidence. Operator authentication lives on **Portfolio Signals workspace** (`/portfolio-signals/workspace`).

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer (`engines.node` in `package.json`)
- npm, using the committed `package-lock.json` (`npm ci`)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Autonomous-Giving-Incorporated.git
cd Autonomous-Giving-Incorporated
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The site remains usable when the public sources are unavailable because the canonical scenario is bundled locally.

### Commands

| Command                             | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                       | Start the local Next.js development server   |
| `npm run lint`                      | Run ESLint                                   |
| `npm run typecheck`                 | Type-check without emitting files            |
| `npm run build`                     | Static export to `out/` (Vercel / production root path) |
| `GITHUB_PAGES_BASE_PATH=1 npm run build` | Legacy project-site path under github.io (optional) |
| `npm run format`                    | Format supported files with Prettier         |

Deploy: [docs/VERCEL.md](docs/VERCEL.md) · Domain: [docs/CUSTOM-DOMAIN.md](docs/CUSTOM-DOMAIN.md)

Before opening a pull request, run lint, typecheck, and `npm run build`.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for system boundaries and [Integration contracts](docs/INTEGRATION_CONTRACTS.md) for the public-data rules.

## Trust and data boundaries

- Join records only through public allocation identifiers—never donor identity.
- Treat source documents as untrusted input and validate authority before display.
- Never fetch raw receipts, private evidence, contact data, or secret URLs.
- Never turn missing or rejected source data into inferred evidence.
- Treat `verified` as a source-system state, not one-to-one donor attribution.
- Keep the contribution demo explicitly deterministic; it is not a payment flow.
