# Three-Repo Integration Surface

This document is the canonical cross-repository integration list for the Autonomously Giving Incorporated suite.

| Repository | Role | Public surface consumed by AGI |
|------------|------|--------------------------------|
| **Autonomous-Giving-Incorporated** (AGI) | Public explanatory workbench and narrative layer | — |
| **Fund-Intel** | Decision workspace + public advisory campaign state | `data/public-campaign.json` |
| **Impact-Relay** | Ledger, evidence, impact receipts, public aggregate outcomes | `data/public-impact.json` |

AGI public workbench is deliberately the thinnest and most constrained surface today. It never writes, never authenticates, and never sees donor-level data.

## Allocation middleware (authenticated client ops)

The **allocation middleware** product ([PRODUCT-ALLOCATION-MIDDLEWARE.md](PRODUCT-ALLOCATION-MIDDLEWARE.md)) is a separate client-ops surface that authenticates and writes tenant data. It is **not** the current public GitHub Pages workbench.

**Status:** MVP implemented in [Fund-Intel `services/allocation-middleware/`](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Fund-Intel/tree/main/services/allocation-middleware) (Hacker Dojo pilot seed, Supabase director login, every.org webhook). Named host + live webhook are operator steps.

| Concern | Public AGI workbench (now) | Allocation middleware (MVP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | None | Supabase director / campaign_lead JWT (operator token fallback) |
| Money path | Narrative only | every.org gift summaries → pots → allocation |
| Writes | None | Pots, allocations, exceptions, proof links |
| Host | GitHub Pages | Fund-Intel Node package (Fly-ready) |
| Specs | Pin v1.x | Capability-first modular monolith |

Cross-repo implementation should keep **public aggregate JSON** contracts stable while middleware modules map to Portfolio Signals (observe/credit), Autonomous Giving (allocate/approve), and Impact Relay (proof/trail) **capabilities**—not three mandatory deployables.

## Current live integration (build-time only)

| Source | Exact URL | Required authority | Required content | Failure behavior |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Fund-Intel | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Fund-Intel/main/data/public-campaign.json` | `advisory_only` | `updatedAt` + `execution.state` | Fail closed → deterministic fixture |
| Impact-Relay | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Impact-Relay/main/data/public-impact.json` | `public_aggregate_only` | At least one outcome with `evidenceState: "VERIFIED"` | Fail closed → deterministic fixture |

Implementation: `integration/public-sources.ts`.

## Shared public contracts (versioned)

Defined in AGI `integration/contracts.ts` (version `2026-08-02`):

- `FundingDecision` — allocationId, fundName, rationale, status, publishedAt
- `ImpactEvent` — allocationId, eventId, type, occurredAt, verificationStatus, optional public-safe evidenceReference
- `PublicImpactNarrative` — decision + ordered events

These contracts are the intended governed seam. The current public-source adapter still projects a narrower slice; full deserialization is Phase C work.

## Full integration checklist

### A. Public data contracts (must stay stable)

- [ ] Fund-Intel continues publishing `authority: "advisory_only"`
- [ ] Impact-Relay continues publishing `authority: "public_aggregate_only"`
- [ ] Impact-Relay always has at least one `evidenceState: "VERIFIED"` outcome when live projection is desired
- [ ] Both documents remain free of PII, donor identity, contact data, and private evidence URLs
- [ ] Schema validation is enforced in each source repository’s CI

### B. Identifier and vocabulary alignment (Phase C)

- [ ] Shared definition of `allocationId` (generation rules + format)
- [ ] Shared status / verification vocabulary mapped across the three systems
- [ ] Named field owners for every contract field
- [ ] Representative public-safe fixtures published in all three repositories
- [ ] Contract version bump process agreed and documented

### C. Reliability & observability (Phase B)

- [ ] Freshness thresholds defined and documented
- [ ] Explicit states: live / fallback / stale / malformed / policy_rejected
- [ ] Runtime schema validation in AGI build
- [ ] Deterministic tests covering every rejection path
- [ ] Privacy-safe build diagnostics (no payload leakage)
- [ ] Accessible provenance labels in the AGI UI

### D. Navigation and identity consistency

- [ ] Reciprocal suite navigation links remain correct on all three public surfaces
- [ ] Shared design tokens / visual language stay coherent (AGI tokens.css is the public reference)
- [ ] Canonical production origins documented (`autogive.app` family)

### E. Explicit non-integrations (do not implement inside AGI)

- Authentication / user accounts
- Payment processing or donation collection
- Runtime writes to Fund-Intel or Impact-Relay
- Donor-level or private evidence access
- Notification delivery
- Direct Supabase or Postgres connections from AGI

### F. Future runtime path (Phase D gate)

Only after B + C are complete and a separate architecture review is approved:

- Narrow read-only server adapter
- Same fail-closed + freshness labeling rules
- No expansion of authority or data scope

## Source ownership summary

| Concern | Primary owner |
|---------|---------------|
| Public campaign advisory document | Fund-Intel |
| Public verified impact outcomes | Impact-Relay |
| Narrative presentation + fail-closed projection | AGI |
| Shared contract vocabulary + allocationId rules | Joint (all three) |
| Public-data / retention / redaction policy | Leadership + all three eng leads |

## Change control

Any change that affects the public JSON shapes, authority values, or contract fields must:

1. Update the relevant schema or TypeScript contract
2. Update fixtures in the affected repositories
3. Bump the contract version if compatibility is broken
4. Update this document and the AGI INTEGRATION_CONTRACTS.md
5. Keep the AGI fail-closed path intact
