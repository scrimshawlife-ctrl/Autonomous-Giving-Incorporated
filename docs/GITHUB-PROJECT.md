## Tracks (current)

### Allocation middleware (active)

- MVP package in Fund-Intel `services/allocation-middleware/`  
- Local Node default; Compose optional; public HTTPS via cloudflared (ephemeral) or Render/Railway/Fly (durable)  
- Director JWT path closed (#72); seed-loop accept closed partial (#74)  
- Remaining: [#73](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Fund-Intel/issues/73) every.org webhook · full [#74](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Fund-Intel/issues/74) browser sign-off

### Hacker Dojo campaign (HD-OI)

- HD-OI-019 hardening, import gates, evidence boundary  
- Separate from allocation middleware but same campaign tenant  

### Platform specs

- Specs v1.x pin, conformance manifests, design docs under `docs/superpowers/`  

### Public suite surfaces

- AGI Pages, Portfolio Signals portal, Impact Relay public aggregate  

### Ops — operator access / commercial onboarding

- People path (C): Fund-Intel `docs/OPERATOR-ACCESS-ONBOARDING.md`  
- Client lifecycle (B): Fund-Intel `docs/COMMERCIAL-CLIENT-LIFECYCLE.md`  
- Second tenant (D): Fund-Intel `docs/SECOND-TENANT-ONBOARDING.md`  
- Allocation pilot: Fund-Intel `docs/HACKER-DOJO-ALLOCATION-PILOT.md` · `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`

## Bootstrap

```bash
# once: grant project scopes
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s read:project,project

# create/link project + seed items
./scripts/setup-github-project.sh
```

Script location: [`scripts/setup-github-project.sh`](../scripts/setup-github-project.sh).

## Conventions

- Prefer **issues** as the project item (not only PRs).  
- Cross-repo work: issue in AGI or Specs with checklist linking the other repos.  
- Allocation middleware work lives primarily in **Fund-Intel** issues; Specs holds design-only items.  
- Do not put secrets, donor PII, or operator tokens in issue bodies.
