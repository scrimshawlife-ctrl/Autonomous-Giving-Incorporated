# Continuation plan

This plan starts from the deployed GitHub Pages experience. Every new capability must make the path from funding intent to verified impact more legible without overstating attribution or exposing private data.

## Current baseline

AGI is a static Next.js export deployed from `main` to GitHub Pages. It includes a replayable deterministic scenario and reads two approved public aggregate documents during the build: a Portfolio Signals advisory state and an Impact Relay verified outcome. Invalid, unavailable, or unapproved source data falls back to the local canonical scenario.

The site does not collect donations, persist records, authenticate people, expose donor-level evidence, or perform write operations against either source system.

## Phase A — Launch hardening (complete)

**Goal:** make the current public experience dependable without expanding product scope.

- Keep canonical, sitemap, robots, favicon, and social-preview assets aligned with the GitHub Pages URL and current visual system.
- Complete a deployed desktop/mobile smoke test, keyboard-only demo replay, reduced-motion review, and metadata preview.
- Record the release owner, commit, deployment run, and verification timestamp.
- Add privacy-preserving analytics only after documenting a measurement question and privacy review.

**Exit criteria:** correct production metadata, a successful Pages deployment, a completed release record, and no new backend dependency.

**Status:** completed on 2026-08-02 through [PR #7](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/Autonomous-Giving-Incorporated/pull/7). CI and the GitHub Pages deployment passed for the merged commit.

## Phase B — Public-source reliability (next)

**Goal:** make the existing read-only source seam operationally explicit and testable.

### Engineering tasks

| ID | Task | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| B1 | Define freshness thresholds and clock assumptions for both public documents | Document threshold (recommended starting point: 24 h soft / 7 d hard) and how the UI labels delayed data |
| B2 | Add runtime schema validation for both source documents | Use the published Fund-Intel schema and the current Impact-Relay public-impact shape; fail closed |
| B3 | Expand internal states to `live` \| `fallback` \| `stale` \| `malformed` \| `policy_rejected` | Keep the deterministic fixture as the only fallback content |
| B4 | Deterministic tests for every selection and rejection path | Network failure, non-2xx, parse error, wrong authority, missing VERIFIED outcome, stale data |
| B5 | Accessible provenance and freshness copy | Labels must work with screen readers and reduced motion; never surface raw payloads |
| B6 | Privacy-safe build diagnostics | CI / build logs report source, age, state, and reason only |

**Exit criteria:** deterministic state coverage, reviewed freshness semantics, monitored fallback behavior, and accessible status copy.

## Phase C — Contract governance

**Goal:** finish the organizational decisions around the existing versioned TypeScript contracts so the three repositories can share a stable public narrative vocabulary.

### Engineering / governance tasks

| ID | Task | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| C1 | Name ownership for every `FundingDecision` and `ImpactEvent` field | Record in INTEGRATION_CONTRACTS.md |
| C2 | Align `allocationId` generation and status vocabulary across Fund-Intel, Impact-Relay, and AGI | Shared glossary + matching fixtures |
| C3 | Approve evidence-access, retention, redaction, and public-publication rules | Leadership + eng sign-off; referenced by all three repos |
| C4 | Publish representative public-safe fixtures in all three repositories | Fixtures must validate against the contracts |
| C5 | Formalize contract versioning and change-management process | Version bump required on any compatibility break |

**Exit criteria:** reviewed schemas, approved public-data rules, deterministic fixtures, and named field owners.

## Phase D — Runtime read-only narrative

**Goal:** move beyond build-time public documents only when a runtime host and operational policy are approved.

- Add a narrow read-only server integration layer; do not introduce accounts, payments, or write operations.
- Preserve the canonical fallback and clear source/freshness labeling.
- Add loading, empty, delayed, and verification-failure states.
- Add structured observability with no sensitive data in logs.

**Exit criteria:** one production-safe runtime narrative, monitored fallback behavior, and an accessibility review.

**Gate:** Phase B and Phase C must be complete and the public contracts must be stable before any runtime work begins.

## Future — Authenticated products

Donor history, organization evidence workflows, payments, and notification delivery remain separately scoped workstreams. They require an approved threat model, consent and privacy review, retention policy, audit requirements, and service ownership before implementation.

## Decision gates

Pause or narrow scope if public data cannot be published safely, identifiers do not join reliably, verification semantics differ between systems, freshness cannot be explained honestly, or the experience implies one-to-one attribution that the evidence cannot support.

## Ownership and sequencing

| Area                                       | First owner             | Sequence |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Pages metadata and release verification    | AGI product/design      | Phase A  |
| Public-source freshness and fallback tests | AGI engineering         | Phase B  |
| Portfolio Signals decision contract               | Portfolio Signals owner        | Phase C  |
| Impact Relay event contract                | Impact Relay owner      | Phase C  |
| Runtime adapter and observability          | AGI engineering         | Phase D  |
| Auth, payments, and notifications          | Product/security owners | Future   |
