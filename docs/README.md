## Maintenance rules

- Update architecture when data flow, deployment, or trust boundaries change.
- Update integration contracts when accepted fields, authority values, or fallback behavior change.
- Update the roadmap for priority changes; keep implementation details in the continuation or implementation plan.
- Add a release record after every material production change.
- Prefer links to canonical documents over duplicated descriptions.
